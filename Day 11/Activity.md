# Automatic Backup of Specific Files Using Scripting and Task Scheduler
Creating an automatic backup of specific files using a shell script and Task Scheduler.

## Step 1: Create the Shell Script

1. **Create the `.sh` file**:
    - Save the following script code in a file named `backup.sh`:

    ```sh
    SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
    SOURCE_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/Scripting.md"
    BACKUP_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/backup"
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)

    BACKUP_FILE="backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

    # Create directory if not exists
    mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

    # Create a compressed backup of the source directory
    tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE" "$SOURCE_DIR"
    ```

2. **Run the shell script in bash**:
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `backup.sh`.
    - Execute the script by running:

3. **Verify the backup**:
    - A `backup` folder will be created in the script directory, containing the backup file.

1. **Extract the backup file**:
    - Navigate to the `backup` folder and extract the `.tar.gz` file using:
      ```sh
      tar -xzf backup-<TIMESTAMP>.tar.gz
      ```
